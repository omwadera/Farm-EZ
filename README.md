# Farm EZ

üé® Abstract :

This project offers a solution for the AgroTech Domain through a web application designed to assist farmers with land leasing and cultivation decisions. By providing comprehensive information about the land and region, including the most commonly grown crops and optimal crop recommendations, farmers can make informed decisions that maximize their agricultural yields. The app's user-friendly interface streamlines the process, allowing farmers to easily access and input critical data, saving them time and effort. Additionally, the application provides the ability to view the plotted map of the location of the registered farm, making it easier for farmers to visualize their land and make location-based decisions.

üëã Introduction :

‚Ä¢ The Agricultural Web Application is a solution that aims to tackle the significant problem of unused land in the farming industry. Our app is designed to assist farmers in leasing their lands to other farmers while providing them with valuable insights into their lands' cultivation. By doing so, we aim to promote the farming industry as a viable business opportunity and help grow this vital sector of the economy.

‚Ä¢ Our team has carefully designed the Agricultural Web Application to provide farmers with the information they need to make informed decisions about their land use. The app offers features such as data on the most commonly grown crops in a particular region and suggestions on the best crops to cultivate for optimal yield and profitability. With its user-friendly interface, the app streamlines the information gathering and input process, making it simple and intuitive for farmers to use.

‚Ä¢ Moreover, the Agricultural Web Application provides farmers with a powerful tool to visualize their data. With the help of the interactive map, farmers can easily view their land and see the different crops grown in the neighboring areas. Additionally, the app offers pie charts and bar graphs to help farmers analyze their crop yields and understand the profitability of different crops.

‚Ä¢ By empowering farmers with valuable insights and tools to manage their land effectively, we are working towards achieving a more sustainable and prosperous future for the farming industry. Whether you are a farmer looking to lease your land or seeking to expand your cultivation options, the Agricultural Web Application is the perfect tool to help you achieve your goals and contribute to the growth of the agricultural industry.

üíª Key Feature-User Interface :

‚Ä¢ Farmers often face the challenge of not being fluent in English, which can hinder their ability to access and use technology-based solutions.

‚Ä¢ To address this challenge, we have decided to add multi-language support to our user interface, which will enable us to offer our web application in Hindi and Marathi, in addition to English. This will greatly improve the accessibility and usability of our web application for farmers who may not be fluent in English.

üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Code Overview :

This is a Flask application that reads data from CSV files and allows users to submit data via a form. The application also generates charts and maps based on user inputs.
The application has two templates: cindex.html and findex.html. The former is used to display charts and maps generated by the application based on user inputs, while the latter is used to display a form for users to submit data.

The application reads two CSV files: FinalDataset2.csv and F_Dataset.csv. FinalDataset2.csv contains data on crop yield in various districts and talukas in India, while F_Dataset.csv contains data on farmers in India.

The application defines two routes:
1.	/crop - displays the form for users to input data to generate charts and maps.
2.	/chart - generates charts and maps based on user inputs.
3.  /submit - receives a form submission, adds them to the DataFrame, and saves it to a CSV file.
4.  /map - a route that generates a map visualization based on user input.

The /crop route takes the following steps:
1.	Receive a GET request from the user's browser to load the /crop page.
2.	Load the HTML form for users to input data to generate charts and maps.
3.	Send the HTML form back to the user's browser as a response.
4.	Receive a POST request from the user's browser with the data entered in the form.
5.	Process the data to generate the requested charts and maps.
6.	Send the charts and maps back to the user's browser as a response.

The /chart route takes the following steps:

1.	Reads the selected district from the form input.
2.	Filters the data in FinalDataset2.csv to only include the selected district.
3.	Calculates the total yield for each crop in the selected district and generates a  bar chart and a pie chart.
4.	Calculates the top 5 crops by yield in the selected district.
5.	Calculates the top 3 districts for each crop selected by the user.
6.	Renders the cindex.html template with the generated charts and maps, as well as the results of the calculations in steps 4 and 5.

The /submit route takes the following steps:

1.	Reads the data submitted by the user via the form.
2.	Uses Geopy to geocode the user's address and extract the latitude and longitude.
3.	Creates a new DataFrame with the user's data and latitude and longitude.
4.	Saves the DataFrame to a CSV file.

The /map route takes the following steps:

1.	Receives user input in the form of coordinates, addresses, or points of interest.
2.	Sends a request to a mapping API to retrieve the necessary data.
3.	Renders the map visualization using the retrieved data.
4.	Displays the map to the user for viewing and interaction.


Overall, the application allows users to input data and generate charts and maps based on the data, as well as submit their own data to be saved to a CSV file.

üìä Data and Model :

The data used in the code includes two CSV files:

‚Ä¢ FinalDataset2.csv: This dataset contains information about crop production in various districts of a particular region. It includes columns such as the district name, taluka name, crop name, and crop yield in kilograms per hectare.

‚Ä¢ F_Dataset.csv: This dataset contains information about farmers, such as their names, ages, email addresses, phone numbers, addresses, district names, taluka names, land sizes, and other information.

The model used in the code is a Flask web application, which is a micro-framework used for building web applications in Python. Flask provides several features such as URL routing, template rendering, and request handling.

The web application created in this code allows users to select a district and up to five crop types. The application then generates two charts: a bar chart and a pie chart, showing the crop yields for the selected crops in the selected district. The application also generates a list of the top five crops with the highest yields, as well as a list of the top three districts for each of the selected crops. Additionally, the web application allows farmers to submit their information, which is then saved in a new DataFrame, along with the farmer's latitude and longitude obtained using the Geopy library.

To summarize, the data used in this code includes information about crop production and farmers, and the model used is a Flask web application that generates charts and allows users to submit their information.

üö´ Limitations : 

This project focuses only on the state of Maharashtra, which may not be representative of the entire country. Therefore, the findings and conclusions drawn from this project may not be applicable to other regions in India with different socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds. Furthermore, the dataset used in this project is limited to the available data sources for the state of Maharashtra, and the results may vary if more comprehensive data is collected.

üöÄ Future Scopes :

1.	Integration of a chatbot to provide farmers with real-time answers to their questions and concerns.
2.	Integration of a weather prediction system to help farmers make more informed decisions about planting and harvesting crops.
3.	Development of a mobile application for easy access to information and data on the go.
4.	Implementation of a machine learning algorithm to predict crop yields and identify patterns in crop growth.
5.	Integration of a system for soil analysis and nutrient management, providing farmers with insights into the health of their soil and ways to optimize crop growth.
6.	Development of a marketplace feature, connecting farmers with potential buyers for their crops.
7.	Implementation of a recommendation system for equipment and machinery based on the specific needs of each farmer.
8.	Integration of a payment gateway to enable farmers to sell their crops online and receive payments directly.
